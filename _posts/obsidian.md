# How I use Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is an incredible project, which I don't aim to explain entirely. This network of pages is meant to share what I've learned about Obsidian and how I came to form my opinions about ways of using it.
My main use is for all stages of [[note-taking|note-taking]], where at the same time I can refine some documents and dump coarse information.

## Vaults

> **Vaults**: A vault is a folder on your local file system where Obsidian stores your notes. You can keep all your notes in one vault, or create several vaults for each of your different projects. ([docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault))

I have two vaults: my dump personal vault, and the digital garden vault.
The main reason is to separate two chunks of work for different audiences. I am the audience for my big dump vault, while you're here seeing the few pretty flowers my brain could generate. Most of the heavy lifting to make readable my coarse work happens in my personal vault, and what my brain understands better is in there. Only a small subset of documents I write makes it to my digital garden, where the final adjustments to that original are curated towards [[organising-knowledge|a different chaos]]. ðŸŒ€

If I didn't have to maintain a digital garden (ðŸŒ±) **I would stick to a single vault**, as most of the work is in duplicated files. It's a tradeoff I can put up with, as long as I want to separate concerns and rip off any need for performance.

## ðŸš§ How I organise stuff in Obsidian and more
I use different [[obsidian-templates|custom templates]] to maintain some order in my Vault.
