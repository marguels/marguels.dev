# Organising knowledge
I've always been an avid scribbler, writing pages and pages of notes pen on papers. As long as I had the concept of subjects dividing my notes, the system was pretty easy.
Switching to a more unstructured learning, like in my job as a Software Engineer, soon made essential to refine another art, together with the art of [[note-taking|note-taking]]: structuring a collection of notes intuitively, breaking from the notion of a blog, so that I could offer browsing to my brain to a wider audience other than myself. ðŸ§ 

I'd love this journey to be an opportunity for a deep dive into search strategies and search engines as well.
In this ambition for an organisation system easy to navigate for others, there is a personal project I'm currently working on. Natural Languages semantic searches have taken it the extra step: creating my own small app for querying my notes. Soon to come! :)

## Strategy
What I know so far is _**when**_ I start writing a note, and _**how**_ I search for it once I need some information back.

The [[obsidian|Obsidian]] answer is: by *tags* or loosely-coupled folders. I love Obsidian's graph function but mostly I use it in an _explorative_ way. I don't use it for the purpose of searching a specific thing. I know that I want a hybrid approach between searching by tags, have few big folders, and explore by tags.

My files are meant to be updated and curated in time, rather than set in stone.
