## Welcome to my little digital garden  🌱

My name is Margherita, and I'm the curator of this little space of the internet.

I've been around here, on the web, soaking up on knowledge, for as far as I can remember.
As I grew and studied, I've decided to claim my own space of this strange, magical place us humans from all around the world have built, where each brick was foundational for something always bigger.
I was convinced that it was time to claim my own space when I stumbled upon the idea of a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/).

Mostly, this space is an excercise to organize my own knowldege. If my efforts are helpful to anyone out there, that would make me more than happy!

### About me
👩🏻‍💻 Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at [Elsevier](http://localhost:3000/elsevier), empowering researchers navigating the intricate world of publications through Scopus. I have been working in this stimulating team for over 3 years as a Back end developer, embarking in the journey of migrating a 15 years old Monolithic application and building awesome micro services and entire full-stack features.

🤖 I spend my free time working on a lot of different projects. Studying, building and creating is what keeps that light in me. I like to level up my programming skills and tie them all together, using coding as a medium to convey my thoughts and creative ideas.

🌌 I have a background in Theoretical Physics (M.Sc.), with a research thesis in Cosmology investigating the Quantum fluctuations caused by Inflation in the early universe. It's a fascinating world sitting in the intersection between the big philosophical questions around the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity and of course some incomprehensible non-equilibrium mathematical models.
  
🧠 For some extra geeky stuff, just know that you can visit my brain (or a more organised version of it). I've spent years soaking up knowledge, researching, and dissecting every topic I could get my hands on. Now, I've got this treasure trove of notes that I can't wait to share with everyone out there. If you're curious and hungry for some mind-blowing insights, swing by [my blog](http://localhost:3000/blog) and get a taste of the bits of knowledge I've gathered along the way!
